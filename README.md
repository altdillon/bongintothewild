# The theme
The theme for this is "masks"  We're still figuring that out.  Based on the exsperinces of the team during covid, this might mean avoiding a pluge or some sort of blight. <br>
The virues will try and move towards the player.  The player has to avoid the virues.  Any contact with a virues will cause the player to lose health. <br>

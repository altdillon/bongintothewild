# Bong into the wild

Working title for our submission to the 2026 global game jam. This is a game for the nentendo entertainment system. It is devloped using [Neslib](https://github.com/clbr/neslib) and is heavily based on exsamples from 
[Making games for the Nes](https://www.amazon.com/Making-Games-NES-Steven-Hugg/dp/1075952727).

# The theme
The theme for this is "masks"  We're still figuring that out.  Based on the exsperinces of the team during covid, this might mean avoiding a pluge or some sort of blight. <br>
The virues will try and move towards the player.  The player has to avoid the virues.  Any contact with a virues will cause the player to lose health. <br>

# Lessons Learned
## tech
This is an interesting topic.  The NES is a now 40 year old system, but there are still some useful lessions we can learn from it.
## teamwork
## gamejam
Where to begin.  Dispite Alex's best efforts we didn't really have a meaningful discussion about what creative direction we wanted the game to take.  This was probably a mistake. Many of the other teams <br>
spent a significant amount of time figuring out what the creative direction for their game was going to be.  Our team was working in the limited confines of the Nes, but it would've been productive talk about that.
